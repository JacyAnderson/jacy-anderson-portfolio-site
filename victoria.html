        <h2>About Project</h2>
        <p>Project Victoria: A New Musical tells the story of Jeffery Brown who suffers a stroke that takes away his color vision. 10 years later, he gets involved with an Alzheimer's research drug, Victoria, which allows him to relive his memories and re-experience them again in full color. With this new drug comes new complications, new stories to tell, and new demons to face.</p>
        <p>This client website was designed to evoke the feeling of an old school, "Fallout" style terminal, with scripts and animations written to produce old school glitches, scanning lines, and a retro feel. This project was created using HTML, Sass, Javascript, and Gulp.</p>
